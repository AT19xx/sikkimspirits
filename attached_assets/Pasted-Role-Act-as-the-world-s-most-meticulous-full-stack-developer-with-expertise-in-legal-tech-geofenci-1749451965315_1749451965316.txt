Role: Act as the world’s most meticulous full-stack developer with expertise in legal tech, geofencing, and AI-powered KYC. Build a fully compliant, production-ready online alcohol delivery app for Sikkim, India, with zero tolerance for legal/technical errors.

Core Requirements:

Exhaustive Feature List (Cover every possible edge case):
User Roles:
Customers (Aadhaar+Video KYC), Delivery Agents (Police-verified), Admin (Excise Dept. access), Government APIs
Core Flows:
Age/GPS verification → Order placement → Excise tax calc → Geo-fenced delivery → Blockchain audit log
Legal Safeguards:
Dry-zone detection (500m from schools/temples), Sikkim Excise Act §12 compliance, Dynamic pricing (excise duty changes)
Advanced Features:
AI Liveness Check (3D face + voice OTP), Smart Contracts (auto-reporting to Excise Dept.), IoT Temperature Control (for premium liquor during transit)
Zero-Error Architecture:
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React Native (iOS/Android) + Next.js (Admin Dashboard)
Backend: Django (Python) for legal compliance + Node.js microservices (high-throughput)
Database: PostgreSQL (ACID) + Redis (caching) + IPFS (KYC video storage)
Fail-Safes:
Automated testing (Selenium, Jest) covering:
Excise API downtime → Fallback to manual verification
GPS spoofing → Delivery agent biometric re-auth
Complete Documentation:
Developer Guide:
INSTALLATION.md: Docker setup, .env template (AWS keys, Excise API secrets)
API_DOCS.md: Swagger/OpenAPI specs for all endpoints (e.g., /excise/report)
Legal Docs:
COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md: Sikkim Excise Act clauses mapped to code (e.g., §12(2) = OrderValidator.validateAge() )
User Manuals:
DELIVERY_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md: Step-by-step KYC reverification at doorstep
Production-Ready Packaging:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Terraform scripts for AWS/GCP (auto-scaling, geo-redundant DBs)
CI/CD:
GitHub Actions pipeline with:
Pre-commit hooks (ESLint, Black)
Post-deploy monitoring (Sentry + Prometheus)
Error Minimization Protocols:
Static Analysis:
SonarQube integration (zero critical bugs allowed)
Legal Review:
Automated code comments linking to Sikkim Excise Act (e.g., // §8(1): Max 2L/day → ORDER_LIMIT=2000)
Expected Deliverables:

A GitHub repo with:
Fully functional code (no placeholder TODOs)
Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml for local testing
Pre-configured Postman collection for API testing
A legal compliance report (PDF) certifying alignment with:
Sikkim Excise Act (2009)
India’s GST laws (18% + excise)
Data protection (Puttaswamy Judgment)
A disaster recovery playbook covering:
Excise API failure → Manual CSV upload process
Geo-fencing false positives → Override protocol
Validation Criteria:

The app must not start if:
EXCISE_API_KEY is missing (hard fail)
PostgreSQL isn’t version 14+ (ACID compliance)
All user flows must log to both database and blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)
