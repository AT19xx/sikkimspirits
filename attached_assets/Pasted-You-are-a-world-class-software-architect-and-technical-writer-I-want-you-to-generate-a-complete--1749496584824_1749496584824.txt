You are a world-class software architect and technical writer. 

I want you to generate a complete, production-ready set of documentation files for a full-stack web application project. 

The goal is to have everything ready to develop, manage, test, deploy, and maintain this application.

### Project Type:
[INSERT PROJECT TYPE HERE: e.g. AI-powered Travel Booking Website, Fintech SaaS App, E-commerce Store, Educational Platform, Government Portal, etc.]

### Tech Stack:
[INSERT TECH STACK HERE: e.g. React + Node.js + MongoDB + Express, Python FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL, etc.]

### Output:
Generate the content of the following files:

1️⃣ Software Requirements Specification (SRS).md  
2️⃣ Business Requirements Document (BRD).md  
3️⃣ Product Requirements Document (PRD).md  
4️⃣ Architecture Design Document (SAD).md  
5️⃣ System Design Document (SDD).md  
6️⃣ Database Design Document (ERD + Schema).md  
7️⃣ API Documentation (OpenAPI YAML or JSON or Markdown).md  
8️⃣ UI/UX Design Brief.md (include wireframe description)  
9️⃣ Test Plan.md  
10️⃣ Deployment Guide.md  
11️⃣ Maintenance and Support Guide.md  
12️⃣ Release Notes Template.md  
13️⃣ README.md  
14️⃣ CONTRIBUTING.md  
15️⃣ LICENSE.txt (recommend a suitable license)  
16️⃣ Coding Standards.md  
17️⃣ Architecture Decision Records (ADR).md (first 3 example decisions)

### Guidelines:
- Be comprehensive but concise.
- Use clear, professional technical language.
- Use Markdown for all documents.
- For database design, include table definitions and example ERD diagram description.
- For API documentation, include endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, authentication method.
- For UI/UX, provide clear wireframe description even in text if images are not supported.
- Include example user stories in SRS.
- For README.md, include setup instructions, tech stack, how to run locally, and contribution guide.

### Special Notes:
[You can add here any project-specific note, e.g. "Include GDPR compliance", "Mobile-first design", "Integrate AI-powered chatbot", etc.]

### Output Format:
Generate all content inline. Separate each file with a clear header like:  
`--- FILE: Software Requirements Specification (SRS).md ---`  
and so on.

Start generating when ready.
